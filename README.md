# 🚀 Sliding Window mastery

A curated collection of **sliding window algorithm problems** covering fixed, variable, and conditional windows. Each solution is optimized, explained with diagrams, and mapped to real-world scenarios like substring processing, analytics, and streaming data.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Well-structured Python solutions  
- Optimized O(n) algorithms (no brute force)  
- Clear explanation of window logic  
- ASCII diagrams showing expansion/shrinking  
- JSON-friendly examples where applicable

## 🏗️ How This Repo Works
- logic.py contain logic of all problems  
- Sliding window logic is explained  
- Key patterns highlighted for **real-world applications**  
- Focus on **maximum length / sum / frequency** using efficient O(n) techniques  

---

## 📌 Problem Patterns Covered
- Fixed-length window (max sum, max product)  
- Variable-length window (longest substring/array with constraints)  
- At most K changes / flips / distinct elements  
- Prefix-sum + window combination  
- Handling negative numbers and large inputs
